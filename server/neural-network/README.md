# Neural Network Analysis for User Ratings

This project implements a neural network to analyze user ratings based on geographical data (latitude and longitude) and corresponding ratings. The neural network is designed to learn patterns from the provided dataset and make predictions based on new input data.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the neural network.
  - **data/**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the neural network.
    - `ratings.csv`: A CSV file with user ratings, including latitude, longitude, and rating values.
  - **models/**: Contains the neural network architecture and training scripts.
    - `neuralNetwork.py`: Defines the neural network model and training process.
  - `train.py`: Script to train the neural network using the dataset.
  - `predict.py`: Script to make predictions using the trained neural network.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**: Run the `train.py` script to train the neural network with the provided dataset.
   ```
   python src/train.py
   ```

2. **Making Predictions**: After training, you can use the `predict.py` script to make predictions based on new input data.
   ```
   python src/predict.py
   ```
